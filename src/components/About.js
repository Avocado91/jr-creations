            Hi, I'm J​udy! I'm a wife and proud mother of two kids living in
            Ottawa, Ontario. I originally got bit by the sewing bug from my
            grandmother and haven't been able to stop ever since. I've been
            sewing for forty plus years now and still love every aspect of it.
            My business originally started with an idea from my daughter, she
            wanted a handbag to match a dress I had made her, and it has only
            spiraled from there. I attend many local craft shows in the area,
            around the fall and spring season. I hand make all of my products
            out of my shop in my home. Those include all kinds of purses,
            clutches, iPad sleeves, gift card holders, credit card holders, coin
            purses, eye glasses cases, tooth fair pillows, as well as hand
            knitted Christmas stockings. I can also create evening attire, for
            weddings, proms and other black tie occasions, or alter most things.
            Take a look around and keep JRCreations in mind for all your
            crafting ​needs.​​
